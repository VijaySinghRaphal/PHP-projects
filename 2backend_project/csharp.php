        <h1>What is C#?</h1>
        <p>
            C# (pronounced "C-sharp") is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft as part of the .NET framework. It was designed to be simple, versatile, and powerful, combining the high-level features of languages like C++ and Java, with the added benefits of being highly secure, easy to learn, and capable of handling both web and desktop applications.
